\section{Impact of Datacenter Placement on the Grid}
\label{sec:quantify}
%PLEASE INCLUDE THIS/APPROPRIATELY EDITED FORM OF THIS TEXT IN INTRODUCTION%%%%
%Today many datacenters are being powered by renewable energy source like wind and solar. There are two choices of locating the datacenters i) near the wind or solar farm, what we refer to as co-location in the paper or ii) away from the renewable energy source (power is transmitted over long distance transmission lines). This paper answers the questions i) how do we decide which of the two is better and ii) how do we plan the datacenter location if we have multiple choices. In order to decide which one of these choices are better we need to define a comprehensive metric. In this paper we will first define these metrics and justify by considering a realistic scenario of placing datacenter in the New England system. Later, we provide a planning methodology that can be used to determine the datacenter location in any electric grid with wind or solar power. Finally, we propose an optimization algorithm that can be used to determine the best datacenter location under a given set of constraints.
%%%%%%%

In this section, we first discuss different ways that the placement of renewable powered datacenters can impact the power grid.  We then describe a simulation system that we have built to quantitatively explore this impact.  Finally, we present some results to show that it is important to consider grid impacts when locating new renewable powered datacenters.

% Planning optimal datacenter location, requires comprehensive metric definition. Most of the studies carried out so far neglect the impact of renewable powered datacenters on the transmission grid. When the penetration of renewable powered datacenters was small, the impact of these on the transmission grid was insignificant. However, with several large datacenter companies opting for renewable energy source it becomes imperative to study their impact on the transmission grid.

\subsection{Potential Impacts}

The rapidly increasing penetration of large renewable powered datacenters can potentially impact the power grid in several ways.

\subsubsection{Overloading of transmission lines}
Transmission lines (also referred to as ``branches'') are used to
transport power from the large generators to the loads in an electric
grid. The power carrying capacity of each line is limited to protect
the line from overheating, mainly due to the line resistive losses,
i.e., $I^{2}R$, where $I$ is the current flowing through the line and
$R$ is the resistance of the line.

A transmission line typically has two ratings: a short term and a long
term capacity rating. During certain wind and system load (including
datacenter load) conditions, some of the transmission lines could get
overloaded. If this happens during the normal operation of the grid,
one of the following will be done: i) if an electronic power flow
controller is available, it is used to control the power flow
through the overloaded line; or ii) in extreme situations, the
overloaded line is disconnected which may result in power supply
interruption to the loads.

If major transmission lines are getting overloaded often during the
year, new lines are planned and built.  As already mentioned,
this solution is very expensive and takes a long time. The need for
such expensive grid retrofits may be minimized by planning the
location of large new generators such as wind farms and large new
loads such as datacenters.

\subsubsection{Voltage variations}
The voltage magnitude varies in the electric grid, and needs to be maintained within a narrow range (for example +/- 5\% of nominal) to avoid damaging sensitive electronic loads.  Unfortunately, there are times when changes in the power output of renewable power plants can cause the voltage to vary beyond the acceptable limits. Such over/under voltage problems can be mitigated by appropriately locating new renewable powered datacenters.

\subsubsection{System losses}
Historically, the electric grid was designed to have large central
generating stations that are located far away from the load
centers. The power from these central sources would be transmitted to
the load centers over transmission lines. While designing such a grid,
the generator location and the transmission line voltage level as well
as the path would be optimized to minimize the line losses.  With
increasing penetration of renewable power, however, this scenario has
changed: the generation sources are distributed and may be located
near the load centers.  Yet, we still use the existing transmission
lines that were planned and built about 50 years ago or earlier.  This
may result in higher line losses and sub-optimal power transmission
between generation sources and loads. Since we cannot re-design the
entire electric grid to minimize line losses, we need to leverage the
flexibility we have in locating new sources and loads, i.e., renewable
powered datacenters in our specific case.


\subsection{Simulation study}
In order to quantitatively study the impact of renewable powered datacenter placement in a power grid, we consider the New England ISO transmission network. We choose this system for the following reasons:

{\em Wind power expansion in New England:} System studies carried out
by the New England ISO show that there is a potential for integrating
up to 12 Giga-Watts of wind power in this region.  This enormous
potential for wind power makes the region an interesting destination
for new datacenters with offsetting wind farms.

{\em Transmission network upgrades:} A study carried out by the New
England ISO shows that they could potentially integrate wind resources
to meet up to 24\% of the region's total annual electric energy needs
in 2020 if the system includes transmission upgrades.  The development
of new wind farms is more economical if these transmission upgrades
can be limited.

{\em Positive impacts of wind power in New England:} Introducing
large amounts of low-marginal-cost wind generation tends to depress
the spot price and reduce the price differential for bulk power
between day and night. The studies above also show that there would be
only a relatively small increase in the use of existing pumped-storage
hydro power for large wind penetrations, mostly because the flexible
natural-gas-fired generation fleet can provide most of the system
balancing.

We will show in our study that wind power penetration can be increased
within the New England ISO transmission system more cost effectively
by strategically locating new datacenter loads. Intuitively, it may
appear that co-locating datacenter loads and wind farms would minimize
their impacts on the transmission grid.  However, this is not
necessarily true since {\em the impact on the transmission grid
  depends on how the placements affect the power flows in the entire
  transmission network}.  For example, strategically placing a new load
can {\em reduce} system losses in a transmission network.

Before we carry out the case studies, we describe the approximations
we make and the models we use for each sub-system to be considered in our
study. 
%\thunote{Divya, I think we need to explain why we are adding wind farms and datacenters to the model.  Also, we need to briefly say how we figured out the bus-to-physical-location mapping.  Finally, we also need to briefly talk about the assumed load on the grid.}

{\em New England transmission system model:} Our study is based on a
widely used model of the New England transmission network
\cite{bills1970line}. A single-line diagram of this test system is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:newengland}. As shown in the figure, the
model lumps all the generators, loads and transmission lines in the
New England ISO region to 10 generators, 19 loads and 46 lines and
transformers. The 10 generator buses are numbered from 30-39 in
Figure~\ref{fig:newengland}. Specifically, bus 39 represents the
aggregation of a large number of generators interconnected to the rest of
US/Canada.  This model includes load data for periods of normal
(nominal) and high loads.

{\em Background datacenters:} Since the model of the New England system was created, large datacenters have been added to the region.  To account for this added load, we collected information on datacenters in the area from~\cite{DCmap}.  Then, using a mapping of the buses in the model to geographic locations, we aggregate all the datacenters in the New England ISO region into six datacenters, each representing datacenters in a state, and placed each aggregated datacenter on a bus appropriate for that state.  We estimate the size of each ``aggregated'' datacenter as 
$L_i=(n_i* 1.45 * 9.8GW)/1278$, where $L_i$ is the aggregated load of the $i$th state, $n_i$ is the number of datacenters in that state, 9.8GW is the upper bound of total electricity used by US datacenters in 2010 \cite{Koomey2011}, 1.45 is a rough estimate of growth in datacenter electricity consumption from 2010 to 2014 (using information from \cite{Koomey2011}), 
and 1278 is the total number of datacenters in the US as reported in \cite{DCmap}.
% However, according to \cite{Koomey2011}, for the summarized load of datacenters, there is an increase of 56\% from 2005-2010. Hence, we are assuming the increasing percentage from 2010-2014 is 56\%*0.8=45\%, and after adjustment we are using $L'_i=1.45L_i$ as the datacenter load for the target grid system.
Table~\ref{tab:dc_setting} shows the placement of these aggregated
datacenters and their sizes.  All datacenters are assumed to be
operating at full capacity.

{\em Background wind farms:} We have similarly added wind farms to the
model to represent recent penetration of wind energy.  Specifically,
lumped models of several wind farms within geographical regions have
been connected to bus 18, 28, 36, 37 and 38.  The locations and
capacity settings of the five wind farms are presented in
Table~\ref{tab:wf_setting}. We assume that each farm can be
represented by $n$ identical wind turbines, where $n$ is equal to the
total farm rated capacity divided by the individual wind turbine
rating. This approximation does not change any of our results because
we are interested in studying the global impact of wind farm powered
datacenters on the electric grid. Also, since most of the wind
turbines in this region are GE 1.5MW machines, we use the wind speed
versus power characteristics of this turbine
model\cite{lei2006modeling}.  For this particular turbine model, the
cut-in wind speed, i.e., the wind speed at which the turbine starts
producing power, is 5m/s and the cut-off wind speed is 25m/s, beyond
which the turbine will be shut down for safety reasons. The wind
turbine produces rated output that grows linearly from near 0MW to
1.2MW for wind speeds from 6m/s to 10m/s, then more slowly to reach
the top rated output of 1.5MW between wind speeds of 13-25m/s.  We
assume that wind farms are not provisioned with energy storage
capacity since energy storage is expensive and not always cost
effective.

% \red{Note that the wind farms don't have energy storage equipped and the wind energy will be directly penetrated into the grid. Our focus is to show that in any electric grid it is important to consider the transmission grid constraints while deciding the data center location. Also we believe that optimally located data center can replace energy storage functionality to a certain extent. For example, the transmission line congestion can be reduced by appropriately placing the energy storage. However, a cost effective and optimal manner to do it is to use the algorithm we have proposed in this paper to locate the data center. Another reason we are not considering energy storage is because there are diverse types of energy storage and not all of them are cost effective. Also we believe that the topic of cost effective and practically viable energy storage is an independent research topic. A comprehensive study has been presented in \cite{rosen2011energy}.}

\subsection{Case study}
\label{sec:casestudy}

We use the above ``modified'' New England model to study the impact of
connecting a new datacenter to an electricity transmission system.
Specifically, we assess the impact using the three metrics described
earlier for three different case studies:

{\bf Case 1:} The base modified New England system.

{\bf Case 2:} The modified New England system with one additional
200MW datacenter co-located with one of the wind farms in
Table~\ref{tab:wf_setting}.

{\bf Case 3:} The modified New England system with one additional 200MW
datacenter connected to a bus away from all wind farms in 
Table~\ref{tab:wf_setting}.

We compute the power flows through the transmission lines, the bus
voltages, and the system losses by solving a set of power flow
equations that model the power balance in a transmission system (i.e.,
net load + losses = total generation).
Within an electric grid the power
can be easily measured at the loads and at generators. Also, some
generators have the capability to regulate the voltage at a bus at a
constant preset reference value. The power flow equations are used to
calculate the bus voltages (magnitude and angle), for a given network
and a set of load and generation powers. The power flow equations for a
generic $n$ bus network with $k$ branches are:

\begin{equation}
P_{i} = \Sigma_{j=1}^{n}(|Y_{ij}||V_{i}||V_{j}|cos(\theta_{ij}+\delta_{j}-\delta_{i}))
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
Q_{i} = -\Sigma_{j=1}^{n}(|Y_{ij}||V_{i}||V_{j}|sin(\theta_{ij}+\delta_{j}-\delta_{i}))
\end{equation}

\noindent where $P_{i}$ and $Q_{i}$ are real and reactive powers at
the $i^{th}$ bus; $|V_{i}|\angle \delta_{i}$ are the voltage magnitude
and angle at the the $i^{th}$ bus; and $|Y_{ij}|\angle \theta_{ij}$ is
the admittance of the branch between $i^{th}$ and $j^{th}$ bus.  For a
given pair of powers $P_{i}$ and $Q_{i}$ at the $i^{th}$ load bus, the
above power flow equations are used to solve for the voltage magnitude
and angle at the $i^{th}$ bus. Since the above equations are
non-linear functions of voltage, they are solved iteratively using the
Newton Raphson method. Once the bus voltages have been calculated, the
line flows and system losses can be computed.

\subsection{Results and Discussion}
%I need only the following results for each case (Case1, Case2 and Case 3):
%1. a table containing system losses for each case (total loss its only one number for each case)
%2. any line capacity violations (line number)
%3. voltage violations if any (bus number)
%%%

We now explore the impact of the above three cases under different
load and wind conditions.

First, we simulate the three cases under peak system load (6,885MW in
total) to explore differences in line overloading.  The wind speed is
set to LOW (4-6m/s), implying that the power generated by the wind
farms is nearly zero (less than 2.3\% of the rated capacity).  For
Case 2, the datacenter is connected to bus 18 (and so is co-located
with wind farm WF1), and for Case 3, the datacenter is connected to
bus 10 (away from all wind farms).  Table \ref{tab:results-linevio}
shows the number of line overloads in the system.  These results
highlight that different placements of the additional datacenter can
affect line overloading.  Although there are only a few cases of
line overload in our experiments, annually the number of overloads and
their durations will depend on the frequency and duration of
occurrences of a particular wind speed and load condition. If it is
too frequent or more persistent, then the overloads could be a serious
problem and might require building new transmission lines. According
to \cite{interconnection2010survey}, the estimated cost of building
new transmission lines of 345kV voltage level is about \$2.5M
per mile, which is very expensive with total costs in the billions
of dollars. Hence, it's important to choose the right place for
datacenters in order to mitigate line overloading occurrences.

\begin{table}[ht]
\begin{center}
\caption{Overloaded transmission lines.}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
{\bf Case} & {\bf No. of overloaded lines} & {\bf List of overloaded lines} \\
\hline
1 & 0 & None\\
2 & 1 &  bus 4 - bus 5 \\
3 & 0 & None \\

\hline

\end{tabular}
%   \vspace{.05in}
\label{tab:results-linevio}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Next, we investigate unacceptable voltage variations in the
transmission system, as shown in Table \ref{tab:results-volvio}. Here,
the wind speed setting is MEDIUM (8-10m/s), which means the generated
power of each wind turbine will be 33.3\%-78.7\% of its rated
capacity.  For Case 2 the datacenter is located at bus 38 (co-located
with wind farm WF5), and for Case 3 the datacenter is located at bus
25 (away from all wind farms). The acceptable voltage range of a bus
is set to [0.95p.u.,1.05p.u.].  We observe that under these
conditions, there is already an unacceptable voltage deviation in the
base modified New England system.  Case 2 increases the number of
unacceptable voltage deviations to four.  In contrast, Case 3 has no
unacceptable voltage deviations.  These results show that unacceptable
voltage variations can be mitigated by carefully choosing the place
for the new datacenter.

\begin{table}[ht]
\begin{center}
\caption{Unacceptable voltage variations.}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
{\bf Case} & \multicolumn{1}{p{1.25in}|}{\bf No. of buses with unacceptable voltage deviations} &
\multicolumn{1}{p{1.25in}|}{\bf List of buses with unacceptable voltage deviations}  \\
\hline
1 & 1 & bus 25\\
\hline
2 & 4 & bus 25, bus 26, bus 28, bus 29\\
\hline
3 & 0 & None \\

\hline

\end{tabular}
\label{tab:results-volvio}
\end{center}
%\vspace{-0.25in}
\end{table}

Finally, we compare the total system losses for the three cases under
three different wind speeds: LOW, MEDIUM, and HIGH.  The results are
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:loss-cases}.  Here, the load is set to normal
(6,254MW in total).  LOW and MEDIUM wind speeds are as before.  HIGH
wind speed corresponds to 11m/s, such that the output power of the
wind turbine is very close to its rated capacity. For example, a 100MW
wind farm would be generating at least 89.6MW of power under HIGH wind
speed.  The datacenter is located at bus 18 (co-located with wind farm
WF1) for Case 2, and at bus 10 (away from all wind farms) for Case 3.

\begin{figure}[hb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{img/loss3cases.pdf}
\caption{Transmission system losses.}% \red{with 95\% confidence intervals}}
\label{fig:loss-cases}
\end{figure}

Results in Figure~\ref{fig:loss-cases} show that the co-location case
(Case 2) could lead to greater loss than Case 1 and Case 3. For
example, at MEDIUM wind speed, the system loss for Case 3 is about 6\%
less than Case 2, which illustrates that system loss can be {\em
  reduced} by careful placement of the datacenter, and co-location
with a wind farm is not necessarily the best choice.  This may seem
counter intuitive.  However, adding a load can alter the power flows
in the entire system, which can lead to significant changes in the
transmission system losses.

Note that even though we have provided only one set of results for a
specific set of conditions, we have simulated different wind speeds and
load conditions.  The results consistently show that the placement of
a new datacenter can impact the number of transmission line overloads,
the number of unacceptable voltage deviations, and system losses,
and that co-location with a wind farm is often not the best placement
strategy.

%% \ref{sec:framework} we will describe a method for determining the
