\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we studied the problem of smartly placing green data centers in proper locations with considering the impact on electricity grid. Since connecting data centers and renewable energy plants to the utility grid will change the power flow of the whole grid network, and thus the grid losses should be incorporated when trying to minimize the total cost. In this context, we proposed an optimization framework with the purpose of optimizing the total cost including data center, renewable energy plant and also the grid cost. The problem is formulated with several necessary constraints according to the reliablity issues for the grid. By solving the problem, we tried to seek for best locations for sitting and provisioning the capacity of both data centers and renewable energy plants. Our optimization results show that considering the grid cost will have different impact on the placement choice for sitting data centers and renewable power plants. This means grid-aware placement stategies could further help saving the overall cost from the perspective of both IT companies and grid operators.
