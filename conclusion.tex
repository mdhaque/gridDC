\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we proposed that new renewable powered datacenters
should be placed intelligently while considering their impact on the
electricity transmission system (along with other datacenter/wind farm
capital and operation costs).  Specifically, we studied the potential
impact of new datacenters on the New England ISO transmission system.
Using simulation, we showed that different placements of a new
datacenter can change the overloading of transmission lines, the
number of unacceptable grid voltage deviations, and transmission
system losses.
% Thus, strategic placement of new renewable powered
% datacenters is critical since ignoring transmission constraints could
% make their developments infeasible given that: 1) it is very expensive to
% build new transmission lines; 2) building a new transmission line
% takes 8-10 years; and 3) in certain cases it is not possible to build
% new lines (for example, lines passing through densely populated cities
% with land constraints).
Even when transmission constraints are met,
strategic placement can lead to lower overall costs for grid operators
and datacenters owners.  We thus developed an optimization framework for
the placement of a new datacenter and offsetting wind farm that
considers transmission constraints and system losses, and used it in a
case study.  Our results show that considering the cost of
transmission system losses can indeed lead to different placements
that achieve lower total cost.
